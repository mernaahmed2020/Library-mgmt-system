# Project Proposal: Library Management System

## Problem Description
The Library Management System aims to automate the management of library resources and streamline operations such as book borrowing, returns, and catalog maintenance. It replaces inefficient manual processes, reduces errors, and provides a user-friendly platform for both library members and staff.

## Functional Requirements
    1. User Registration.
    2. Book Search and Browsing.
    3. Borrowing Books.
    4. Returning Books.


## Non-Functional Requirements
    - Persistent storage of library member and book data.
    - Support for 50 concurrent users accessing the system.
    - All operations (e.g., book searches, borrowing) must complete within 3 seconds.
