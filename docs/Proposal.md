# Project Proposal: Library Management System

## **Introduction**
Libraries play a vital role in providing access to knowledge and fostering education, but traditional library management systems often rely on manual processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. The proposed Library Management System (LMS) is designed to modernize library operations by automating key tasks such as catalog management, borrowing, and user services.

By replacing outdated methods with an intuitive digital solution, the LMS aims to enhance the overall library experience for both staff and members. It reduces administrative burdens, improves the accuracy of records, and provides convenient access to resources through user-friendly features.

## **Objectives**
    1. Streamline library operations such as book borrowing, returns, and catalog updates.
    2. Provide a digital platform for users to search, browse books.
    3. Ensure efficient and accurate record-keeping for members and books.
    4. Support administrative functions like library announcements and transaction oversight.
    5. Deliver a fast and reliable system capable of serving multiple users simultaneously.

## **Functional Requirements**
The system will include the following core functionalities:

    1. **User Registration**: Allow users to register for library access, creating unique profiles with secure credentials.
    2. **Book Search and Browsing**: Enable users to search for books by title, author, genre, or ISBN and browse the catalog.
    3. **Borrowing Books**: Allow users to borrow books, updating availability status in real time.
    4. **Returning Books**: Facilitate book returns, including notifications for overdue books and late fees.
    5. **View Borrowing History**: Let users review their borrowing history, including current and past transactions.
    6. **Library Announcements**: Provide administrators with a platform to post announcements visible to all users.

## **Non-Functional Requirements**
    1. **Data Storage**: Use a robust database to persistently store library member and book data.
    2. **Performance**: Ensure all operations, such as book searches and transactions, complete within 3 seconds.
    3. **Scalability**: Support up to 50 concurrent users accessing the system without performance degradation.
    4. **Usability**: Deliver a clean, user-friendly interface accessible to users with varying technical expertise.
    5. **Security**: Protect user credentials and sensitive data with encryption and secure authentication methods.
